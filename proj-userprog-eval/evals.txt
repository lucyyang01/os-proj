Daisy Polanco|69|20|I worked with Daisy on file operation syscalls, floating point operations, and a custom test on the report. Daisy carried floating point and we worked well together. She also worked on several sections in the design document. I feel that we both wrote equal lines of code and that we were able to effectively bounce ideas off of each other. 
Esther Sue|64|20|Worked on all deliverables. In the code, she worked on argument passing and process syscalls, and contributed to those sections on the design document as well. She also helped figure out our memory leaks for the oom test and wrote a custom test. She worked with Ricky as a pair.
Ricky Liu|120|20|Worked on all deliverables. In the code, Ricky worked with esther on argument passing and process syscalls and also wrote a custom test case. He also worked on debugging the rox tests. Overall I think that Esther and Ricky worked on the harder portion of the code, but I feel like we worked really effectively as a group.
